# Caesar Cipher

Here's how Caesar Cipher works:

Implement a Caesar Cipher in `main.py`

For an extra challenge you could try:

* wrap everything in an `encrypt` function that takes in plaintext and returns ciphertext, with a `key` as a parameter that says how many letters forward or back you will shift the alphabet
* make a corresponding `decrypt` function that also takes a `key` as input, that takes in ciphertext and returns plaintext
* write an automatic code breaker for a Caesar cipher that uses a `for` loop to try out lots of keys --- if you do this, try sending each other secret messages
* implement a [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) were you use a different `key` for each position in the plaintext
